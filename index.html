        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website! I am a 22-year-old musician based in San Luis Obispo, California. 
            I first moved to SLO in 2021 to attend Cal Poly, where I performed with the Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Combos. 
            Before that, I grew up in San Jose, where I picked up the nickname ‚ÄúBenny G.‚Äù While that name stuck, 
            feel free to just call me Ben if you come say hi after a show.
        </p>

        <p>
            These days, I perform throughout SLO County in styles ranging from Jazz to R&B, Soul, and Funk. 
            This includes being the house bassist for the BA Start and Libertine Jazz Jams, bassist in the R&B/Soul group 
            <strong>Silk Ocean</strong>, and occasionally performing with <strong>Brass Mash</strong>. 
            My main focus, though, is being the bassist, singer, and bandleader of <strong>The Sweet Spots</strong>, 
            an R&B/Soul/Funk band I started in the spring of 2024 with like-minded musicians who share my love for soul music. 
            Watching the band grow has been an incredible joy and a deeply fulfilling experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            While bass is my primary instrument, I also sing and play guitar, drums, and a bit of piano, which all fuel my creativity 
            and help me connect with music from different angles. Along with that, I offer services as a composer and arranger. 
            I regularly collaborate with my bandmates in <strong>The Sweet Spots</strong> to write original music and serve as the band‚Äôs 
            main chartwriter. I've also composed and arranged works for jazz combos and am currently working on a chart for <strong>Brass Mash</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            All in all, at the heart of everything I do is a passion for spreading the language of music and a constant drive 
            to keep learning, growing, and sharing my craft with the world. Thank you so much for visiting my website, and I hope to see you at a show soon!
