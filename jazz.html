                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve been performing jazz since middle school, playing in big bands and small combos on both upright and electric bass. I started gigging professionally in high school and released an original jazz EP my senior year. While at Cal Poly, I played bass in the university’s big band and jazz combos, earning multiple awards for outstanding soloing and musicianship. Today, I serve as the house bassist for two local jazz jams in San Luis Obispo and lead my own group that performs a mix of standards, originals, and arrangements. I’ve also had the privilege of studying under renowned jazz musicians Michael Ragonese and Alex Hahn through the Libretto Conservatory.

                <h3>Jazz Jams</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve been an active part of the San Luis Obispo jazz community for over four years, performing regularly and helping foster the local jam scene. 
                    I play in the house band and help organize a couple of recurring jazz jams around town:

                <h3>Other Gigs</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to playing in local jazz jams and ensembles, I’m available as a freelance bassist or guitarist for live performances, studio sessions, and special events. 
                    I regularly perform across the Central Coast, both as a sideman and as a bandleader, and can provide groups ranging from solo and duo settings to full jazz combos or big bands depending on the occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re looking for a groove-oriented rhythm section for a private event, a mellow trio for a winery gig, or a high-energy band for a festival stage, I can help bring the right music to your space.

                <h3>Composition & Arranging</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to performing, I’m an experienced composer and arranger specializing in jazz music. 
                    Whether you’re looking for an original piece for your combo or a full arrangement for big band, 
                    I can create music tailored to your group’s strengths and style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I released my first original jazz EP while still in high school and have continued composing and arranging ever since.
                    Many of my charts can be heard at gigs with my bands around the Central Coast.
